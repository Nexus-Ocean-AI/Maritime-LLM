They are the same thing. The Chief Mate is the second in command of the vessel. The Master is the first in command.

The only difference is the size of the ship. There are some exceptions such as a Ro-Ro which is a roll on/roll off ship. It is used to transport cars and trucks. There are also container ships which carry containers. These are usually stacked on top of each other. There are also cruise ships which are used for tourism. They are usually very large and have many amenities such as pools, restaurants, and even nightclubs. There are also cargo ships which are used to transport goods from one place to another. These ships are usually very large and have many decks. There are also tugboats which are used to push or pull other ships. These ships are usually very small and have a lot of power. There are also fishing boats which are used to catch fish. These ships are usually very small and have nets attached to them. There are also oil rigs which are used to drill for oil. These ships are usually very large and have drilling equipment attached to them. There are also submarines which are used to explore the ocean floor.

I don’t think there is such a thing as “all the different types of ships”.
There are many different types of ships, but they can be grouped into broad categories based on their primary function. For example, cargo ships, passenger ships, fishing vessels, research vessels, military vessels, etc.
The list you posted is a good start, but it’s not exhaustive. There are many other types of ships that could be added to the list, such as tugboats, dredges, barges, offshore supply vessels, and so on.
If you’re looking for a more comprehensive list, you might want to check out the International Maritime Organization (IMO) website. The IMO is responsible for developing and maintaining international standards for shipping, including classification of ship types. Their website has a lot of information about different types of ships and their uses.
Alternatively, you could try searching online for “types of ships” or “ship classification” and see what comes up. There are many resources available online that provide detailed information about different types of ships and their characteristics.
Hope this helps!

There is no such thing as “all” the different types of ships. There are too many to list here. If you want to get started, look at the Wikipedia article on ship types.

I think you will find that there are more types of ships than you could ever imagine. The only way to get a complete list would be to go to the USCG website and read the CFRs. But even then you might miss some obscure type of vessel.

I’m not sure what you mean by “ships”. Do you mean vessels that float on water? Or do you mean vessels that are propelled by mechanical means?
If you mean vessels that float on water, then the answer is: All of them.
If you mean vessels that are propelled by mechanical means, then the answer is: All of them.
If you mean vessels that float on water and are propelled by mechanical means, then the answer is: All of them.
If you mean vessels that float on water and are propelled by mechanical means and are used for commercial purposes, then the answer is: All of them.

Thanks,[/QUOTE]
I’m not sure what you mean by “more practical in nature”. Ship stability is a very complex topic and there is no way around having to learn the theory behind it. The only way to understand how to apply the theory is to learn the theory first. If you want to be able to do calculations without using software then you will need to learn the theory.
If you are looking for a book that explains the theory in an easy to understand manner then I recommend “Ship Stability for the Mariner” by James W. Hendrix. It is written in a very clear and concise manner and is easy to understand even for someone who has never taken a course in calculus.

I would suggest you start by reading the USCG’s “Ship Stability” manual. It is available online at http://www.uscg.mil/directives/cim/16000-16999/CIM_16000_1B.pdf

I’m sure you’ve already tried this, but try calling the companies instead of just sending emails. It’s more work for you, but it’s worth it.
Also, if you’re willing to work on a harbor assist boat, there are plenty of jobs available. Just about every company has a need for new people. If you’re willing to work on a push boat, there are fewer jobs, but they’re still there.
If you’re really serious about getting a job, you might want to consider going to a school that offers a 6 month program that will get you your AB ticket and some sea time. That way you’ll be able to go to work right away, and you won’t have to wait for a company to hire you. The schools are expensive, but you can pay for it yourself, or take out a loan. You’ll probably end up paying the same amount of money either way, but at least you’ll be able to start working sooner.

They are not the same license. The 1600 Master is a domestic license, the 3rd Mate is an international license. They are both unlimited tonnage licenses, but the 1600 Master is limited to near coastal waters (domestic) while the 3rd Mate is unlimited in scope (international).
The 1600 Master is also a domestic license, but it is not limited to near coastal waters. It is valid on any domestic vessel up to 1600 tons anywhere in the world. The 3rd Mate is an international license, so it is valid on any vessel anywhere in the world.

I don’t think you will find any steam tugs in the US. The last one I know of is the “Cape Elizabeth” which is a 250’ tug built in 1946. She was converted to diesel in 1978.
The only steam tugs I know of are in the UK. They are mostly old WW II era tugs that were converted to diesel in the 1960’s. There are a couple of new ones being built now.

I’m not sure if you’re looking for a book that covers the entire history of the U.S. Merchant Marine or just WWII. If the latter, I’d recommend “The Second Battle of the Atlantic” by Daniel Allen Butler. It’s a great read and covers the entire war from both sides. I think it was originally published in 1985, but I’ve seen it available as recently as 2006.
If you’re looking for something more comprehensive, try “The United States Merchant Marine: A History” by Thomas B. Allen. I haven’t read it myself, but it looks like a good resource.

I don’t think there is a “complete” list anywhere. There are too many variations and combinations of ship types.
The list you posted is pretty good though. It’s not exhaustive but it covers most of the major types.
If you want to get really specific, you can look at Lloyd’s Register’s Ship Classification System. They classify ships by type and then by size. So you could find all the different types of bulk carriers, for example, and then see what sizes they come in.

I am looking for a good book on the subject of ship handling. I have read “Shiphandling for the Mariner” by Captain Richard Plant but I am looking for something more in depth.
Any suggestions?

I’m not sure if this is what you’re looking for, but it’s a great resource:
http://www.shiphandling.info/
It’s a website that has a lot of information about ship handling, including videos, books, and other resources.

I would suggest “Ship Handling for the Mariner” by Captain Richard Plant. It is a very good book and covers a wide range of topics. It is also very well written and easy to understand.

I have my 3rd A/E license and I have been working on tugs for about 10 years. I have worked on tugs in the gulf of Mexico, Alaska, and the east coast. I have also worked on a few OSV’s. I have a lot of experience with diesel engines, but not much with steam. I would like to work on a tug that has a steam engine. I have heard that there are some tugs out there that have steam engines. If anyone knows of any tugs that have steam engines please let me know.

I’m not sure if this is what you’re looking for, but I found this one to be pretty good:
http://www.amazon.com/Shiphandling-Principles-Practice-Second-Edition/dp/087033569X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1247111101&sr=8-1
It’s a little pricey, but it’s got some good stuff in it.
Good luck!

I’ve always liked the old “Shiphandling” by Capt. J. H. White. It’s a bit dated, but still has a lot of good information. I also like the “Shiphandling in Narrow Channels” by the same author. It’s a bit more specific to narrow channels, but still has a lot of good information.

I don’t know if this is still relevant, but I just got hired by Reinauer Transportation in NY Harbor. I was hired as an OS and they are sending me to school next week for my STCW BST. I’ll be getting my AB Special in about 6 months. I’m excited to get started!
